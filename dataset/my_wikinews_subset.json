Futtuh, head of the Palestinian parliament, was sworn in hours after the death of Yasser Arafat on Thursday, and Palestinian Basic Law dictates that he may only serve up to two months before elections are held.\n\nNew leadership could prove to be the key to revitalizing the peace process in the Middle East, as both Israel and the United States had refused to work with Arafat.\n\nThe Haaretz had initially reported that former prime minister Mahmoud Abbas was selected by the Fatah central committee as their candidate for president, but Abbas has denied this, saying, \"the matter is still being discussed.\" There have also been conflicting reports on whether or not jailed Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti will run.\n\nBarghouti is currently serving five life sentences in Israel for attacks against Israelis. Nonetheless, he remains a popular figure among Palestinians for his role in the Palestinian uprising, and could potentially win the election if he decided to run.\n\nA win by Barghouti could put Israel in an awkward spot; however an Israeli official said this week that he would not be freed, and a landslide win by Barghouti would signify to them that the Palestinians were not yet ready for peace.",

The process of conversion modifies the uranium oxydes into uranium hexafluoride. The purpose of such a conversion process is usually an intermediate step in the production of nuclear fuel. Uranium hexafluoride cannot itself be used in a nuclear weapon, but can be enriched into weapons-grade uranium, or it can be converted into plutonium in a nuclear reactor.

May your government work untiringly to settle disputes and conflicts through dialogue and negotiation, having recourse to military force only as a last resort. Accordingly, it is essential that the State, with the assistance of the International Community, promote mutual understanding and tolerance among its various ethnic and religious groups.

    "text": "UK Health Secretary John Reid has proposed widespread legislative and health care changes in a new white paper on public health released Tuesday. Titled \"Choosing Health\", the paper details government plans to restrict smoking in public places, limit 'junk food' advertisements to children, make available \"lifestyle trainers\", campaign against sexually transmitted diseases and tobacco, and improve food labelling.\n\nThe white paper comes after extensive public comment that involved 150,000 people.\n\nSmoking would be restricted in enclosed public spaces, restaurants, workplaces, and some pubs. The ban would be enacted gradually, affecting government and NHS buildings in 2006, enclosed public places in 2007, and private property in 2008. Permanent exemption would be granted to pubs that do not serve prepared food -- though not at the bar -- as well as private clubs, a decision that has provoked some to call the measure incomplete. Up to 90% of pubs are expected to be affected. The Scottish executive proposed a complete ban on smoking in enclosed public places last week, and Ireland has already banned smoking in pubs and restaurants.\n\nFood advertisements targeted to children would be banned until 9pm, under the White Paper's proposals. The restriction is a measure to tackle rising rates of childhood obesity. The government also intends to develop voluntary standards on food and drink advertisements to children with industry, only threatening legislation if an acceptable standard is not reached by 2007. Additionally, low income families would receive vouchers for fresh fruit, vegetables, milk, and infant formula. School lunches would also be held to stricter nutritional standards. Reid has warned that unless childhood obesity is tackled, \"we face the prospect of children having shorter life expectancy than their parents\".\n\nFood labelling would also be improved, with a \"traffic light\" system implemented. Packaged food would be evaluated based on its fat, sugar, and salt content.\n\nThe paper is unusual for suggesting a more holistic approach to health care, offering for the first time \"lifestyle trainers.\" The National Health Service would be funding with an additional \u00a31bn to make people's overall lives healthier, which is expected to save \u00a330bn in preventable illness.\n\nThe paper additionally makes mention of reducing accidents, which affected 2.7m people last year and is a leading cause of child death, curb binge drinking, and reduce substance abuse among youths.\n\nThe paper has been criticized by many parties. The Tory Shadow Health Secretary has criticized the Labour government's comprehensiveness and creation of a \"new nanny state approach\". He has additionally described it as \"gimmicks\". The Liberal Democrats have accused the government of not being comprehensive enough. It has also been criticized by the British Medical Association as being implemented too slowly, saying \"When lives need saving, doctors act immediately\".\n\nMr. Reid has argued against the nanny state label, saying \"In a free society, men and women ultimately have the right within the law to choose their own lifestyle, even when it may damage their own health. But people do not have the right to damage the health of others, or to impose an intolerable degree of inconvenience or nuisance on others ... This is a sensible solution which balances the protection of the majority with the personal freedom of the minority in England\".\n\nThe full white paper \"Choosing Health\" can be read here.",

Al Jazeera was also said to have received the tape days ago, but after delaying to confirm Hassan's identity, ultimately decided not to broadcast it.\n\nThe international organization CARE was shocked by the news. Hassan led the CARE-department in Iraq for years.\n\nSince her kidnapping on October 19, 2004, has appeared on several tapes pleading for her life. She made a personal request addressed to Prime Minister Tony Blair to remove British troops from Iraq to meet her kidnappers demands.",

The Tatars had instituted legal proceedings because their Turkic language differs greatly from Russian, the BBC reports.\n\nThe law banning all alphabets but Cyrillic has been one in a long range of regulations and restrictions, claimed by officials to be designed to protect Russia's linguistic heritage. The Russian federal government has been cited to consider the use of a non-Cyrillic alphabet by federal states a 'separatist tendency'.",

    "title": "Japan to reduce aid to China",
    "text": "Japan's Diet has proposed to reduce economic assistance given to China. Economic aid is currently given in the form of grants and technical assistance under the Official development assistance (ODA) program. ODA contributes to the development of the economies of states harmed by Japan during World War II, an approach pursued not only as restitution but to improve regional stability and to secure scarce natural resource trade.\n\nAssistance to mainland China will total $8.9bn this year, making Japan an unusual second to the United States in aid. This is down 30% from 1997, and is the fourth year-on-year decline as of 2003. Loans to China total $30bn to date.\n\nThe ODA has been a key feature in Sino-Japanese economic and diplomatic relations. It was begun in the 1980s as China \"opened up\" to foreign investment. It is in part restitution for damage inflicted on China and atrocities such as the Rape of Nanking, seen in Chinese culture in much the same way as The Holocaust is in Western culture.\n\nChina is increasingly being seen as a competitor, however. Popular opinion in Japan is also increasingly resentful of what is perceived as anti-Japanese sentiment in China. Some feel that China should be grateful for ODA funds and that it is not. China has also been criticized by Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura for not being sufficiently cooperative with regards to environmental issues, which necessarily affect its eastern neighbor Japan.\n\nThe People's Republic of China's Communist leaders have also been criticized for violating w:human rights and effecting a military build-up. Some argue that economic aid should be tied to compliance on relevant standards.\n\nThrough the ODA, Japan enjoys the support of many developing nations in UN votes. When China did not react favorably to Japan's intention to seek permanent UN Security Council membership, The Japan Times criticized the aid as a \"complete waste\".\n\nAsia Times Online predicts \"it is inevitable that funds flowing to China are set for further downsizing.\"\n\nTotal Japanese expenditures on ODA have reached $221bn distributed to 185 nations. Currently, the biggest recipient of Japan's ODA aid is India. Japan may soon be outspent in aid to China by France, Germany and Italy.",

Controversy was sparked by his choice of conservative Italian Rocco Buttiglione for the Justice Commissioner position, who made several statements regarding homosexuality and women that members of the European Parliament objected to.\n\nHis new line-up, according to the BBC, is mostly identical to his previous one; only two previous candidates (the Italian Buttiglione and the Latvian Ingr\u012bda \u016adre) have been replaced. The European Parliament voted in favour the Commissioners on November 18th, giving Barroso and his staff the green light to start their official five-year term starting on Monday. While the Greens, Eurosceptics and the Communist Party voted against, the Commission secured the approval of the Parliament's biggest parties - the Socialists, the Liberals and the European People's Party. The vote ended with 449 in favour, 149 against and 82 abstentions, CNN reports.",

    "text": "Prime Minister Ariel Sharon considered a temporary coup d'\u00e9tat of the Israeli government with other members of the Israeli military shortly before the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, it has been revealed.\n\nDays leading up to the '67 Arab-Israeli War featured a build-up of Egyptian, Syrian, and Iraqi forces on the border that was perceived by many as a threat to the very existence of Israel. Military advisors pressured for a preemptive strike, which was felt necessary to offset Israeli numerical inferiority. Then-Prime Minister Levi Eshkol was under intense pressure from his cabinet and military on the decision to pursue diplomacy or war. Many pro-war officials considered war inevitable and a delay only harmful to Israel.\n\nAriel Sharon was a Major General in the Israeli military during the war. On May 28th, he advised the Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin that the cabinet could be detained and a coup declared. Sharon and others felt that the civilian government was unable to reach a necessary decision. The military would make the decision the government would not, and begin war in the government's best interests.\n\nHe explains: \"We often asked whether in the State of Israel there could arise a situation in which the army takes control. And I always said it was impossible, that this couldn't happen in the State of Israel.\"\n\n\"And then, after the meeting on May 28, I said to the chief of staff and others who were present, that there had arisen a situation in which this could happen, and that it would also be well accepted - that is to say, to seize control not in the framework of wanting to govern, but in the framework of making a decision, the fundamental decision, and that the army can make it without the government.\"\n\n\"I don't remember if he agreed or not, but I think he also viewed it in this way.\"\n\nSharon stressed that no definite plan existed. However, he defended giving it serious consideration, saying: \"They the civilian government would have accepted it with a sense of relief. That was my feeling.\"\n\nPrime Minister Eshkol later decided in favor of war on June 5th. Ariel Sharon served as a commander of the Southern Division. His comments may be found in full in Ma'arachot, a publication by the Israeli defense ministry.",

The deal is to cost $11.5bn and will lead to the creation of the third-largest U.S. retailer, after Wal-Mart and Home Depot, and replacing Target at number three.\n\nThe new company, which is to be called Sears Holdings and be based near Chicago, will have $55 billion in annual revenue and nearly 3,500 retail stores. Edward Lampert, the chairman of Kmart, will become the chairman of the new company, while Alan Lacy, current chairman and chief executive of Sears will be the new chief executive. Sears CEO Alan Lacy, speaking about the deal, promised up to $500 million a year in savings within three years from improved efficient, greater purchasing power and possible store closures. The stores will retain their current names.\n\nThe purchase will allow the two stores to sell each other's brands, including Craftsman Tools, Kenmore, and Lands' End from Sears, and Martha Stewart and Joe Boxer brands from Kmart. The move is considered a boon for Sears, which until recently has confined itself to malls, and can now sell its products in the many Kmart locations.\n\nShares of both companies soared after the announcement, Sears was up 22 percent on Wednesday, whilst Kmart gained 15 percent.",

For the six months to 9 October, it reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a339m ($72m), compared with a profit of \u00a3323m the previous year.\n\nExcluding \u00a3168m of exceptional items, such as the clearance of surplus merchandise, Sainsbury's made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3131m for the first half of its financial year. The company had made a profits warning earlier in the year. The company's shares actually rose slightly on the news. This is due to the absence of any surprises - shareholders were expecting results in line with these.\n\nSainsbury's chief executive Justin King admitted the firm had been failing to properly stock its shelves after struggling with faulty distribution systems. This problem however is only one of a series of problems that has plagued Sainsbury's in recent years. Once the UK's largest supermarket chain, Sainsbury's has been overtaken by both Tesco and Asda in recent years.",

    "title": "Chinese submarine enters Japanese waters",
    "text": "Tenuous relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China were strained last week when a Chinese nuclear-powered submarine entered Japanese territorial waters southwest of Okinawa.\n\nThe intrusion occurred on 10 November, Japanese time (UTC+9). The submarine was quickly spotted by Japan's Self-Defence Forces and was tracked by helicopter as it wandered in Japanese waters for two hours before moving north-west. International law requires a tracked submarine to surface and identify its nationality in times of peace; the submarine did not do so.\n\nMany Japanese officials in the Defence Agency considered the intrusion an act of provocation and \"showing off,\" as the submarine in question was a particularly noisy model. It continued traveling very slowly after being spotted, and remained in shallow waters. The intrustion caused Japanese Self-Defense Forces to go on alert for the second time since the Second World War.\n\nThe submarine in question is believed to be a Type 09-1 Han Class attack submarine. It is a nuclear-powered submarine designed in the 1950s and first built in the 1974. This class of submarine is thought to suffer numerous defects, including radiation leakage, noise, and an inability to fire missiles while submerged. Only two of five submarines are thought to be operational. China has recently begun an active modernization of its navy.\n\nOn 17 November, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Daiwei met with the Japanese ambassador to China Anami Koreshige in Beijing and offered an apology for the incident, stating that the submarine was on a training mission and the intrusion was due to a \"technical error\" and was \"regrettable.\" Japan's Defence Agency is studying whether \"technical errors\" is a feasible explanation for the incident.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro has publicly stated he wishes to speak with Chinese President Hu Jintao about this and other matters of Sino-Japanese contention at the upcoming annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile later this month.\n\nDespite the increasingly close economic ties between the two nations, distrust has long exisited between Japan and China. Many Chinese people still resent the Japanese invasion and occupation of China during World War II and Japan's refusal to formally apologise. Japan, on the other hand, sees China as a potential competitor and an increasing threat to its national security.\n\nJapan's Constitution forbids the nation from exercising military strength in matters other than that of self-defence, but Japan's ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party or LDP, has recently proposed constitutional amendments to give the military more offensive capabilities, among other things.",
